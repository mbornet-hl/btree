Binary trees management

This repository contains C source code implementing balanced binary tree management.

Searching for an element is in O(Log(n)).

Sorting a set of elements is in O(n.Log(n)).

Examples (in the "ea" directory) show how to generate the code for the drawing of a binary tree in LaTeX. The LaTeX_output directory contains sample output files.
